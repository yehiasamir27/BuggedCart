# BuggedCart 🛒 — OWASP Top 10 Training App

BuggedCart is a full-stack web application built with **Flask** and **SQLite** for practical learning of web security and ethical hacking. It uses a simple shopping/cart website to present OWASP Top 10 scenarios in a realistic way, similar to DVWA-style learning labs.

The project includes dedicated lab pages that demonstrate common web security weaknesses and their secure fixes. Each lab supports **patched** and **unpatched** modes, allowing learners to test the risky behavior, then switch to the secure version to understand the correct mitigation and defensive approach.

## How this project helps
- Practice OWASP Top 10 with real web app flows (forms, sessions, database queries)
- Understand attacker techniques by testing the **unpatched** mode
- Learn secure fixes by switching to the **patched** mode
- Build skills in web security testing and secure coding in a safe local lab

⚠️ **Warning:** This project contains insecure examples. Use only for learning in a local or isolated environment.
